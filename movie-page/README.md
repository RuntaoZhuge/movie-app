
This is a movie page made by Max Zhuge for this coding assignment.


## Getting Started (Please clone the master branch to run it on local)

### node version 12.22.3

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm dev
# or
yarn run dev
```
The site can be viewed at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

To run it locally, for secure consideration. Even though the api key for this site is easy to get. It is not included in the repo, so when running it locally, please create .env file and add the api key to the file in the fomat below:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_OMDb_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```
You can get the api key easily from:
[OMDBAPI](https://www.omdbapi.com)


### This site has also been automatically deployed on vercel with some simple checks on (Slightly different from the development environment. I think it's caused by the node version difference):
